Overview
========

To use the nagios2 resources, activate storeconfigs on the puppetmaster.

Monitor
-------

On one node the "nagios2" class has to be included. This installes nagios2 and
apache2 and configures the cgi on http://node/nagios2/


Hosts
-----

On a node which shall be monitored with nagios, include the "nagios2::target".
This just creates a host declaration for this hosts "$fqdn".
Set the $nagios_parent variable in the node scope for enabling the reachability
features of nagios2. If a node needs more customisation, use the
"nagios2::host" component directly.

To monitor hosts not managed by puppet, add "nagios2::extra_host"s to the
monitoring node. These can be used as intermediate $nagios_parent's


Services
--------

Services can be monitored by using the "nagios2::service" component.

The simplest form is::

	nagios2::service { check_dns: }

The intention being obviously to put such declarations into a component defining
a service, thereby being automatically applied together with all instances of
the service.



Caveats
=======


Performance
-----------

A major drawback is that currently the needed storeconfig setting and
subsequent filling of the database is really a drag on performance. 0.22.1
for example breaks at approximatly 120 monitored services (depends on H/W of
course). 0.22.3 has improved that my a factor of 3-4. 


Consistency/Validation/Verification
-----------------------------------

After convergance of the configuration, the system is obviously consistent.
That is, all defined services are monitored. The problem is though, that it is
neither automatically valid - it is not guaranteed that all components declare a
nagios2::service - and even if the configuration is valid it definitly is
unverified, since that is always a judgment call for an external observer.



Examples
========

Usage example::

node nagios {

	include nagios2

	# Declare another nagios command
	nagios2::command { http_port: command_line
=> '/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_http -p $ARG1$ -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -I
$HOSTADDRESS$'

	# Declare unmanaged hosts
	nagios_extra_host {
        	"router01":
                	parent => "gateway",
                	ip => "10.0.0.1";
        	"router02":
                	parent => "router01",
                	ip => "192.168.0.1";
	}

}


node target {

	# Monitor this host
	$nagios_parent = "router01"
	include nagios_target

	# monitor a service
	$apache2_port = 8080
	include apache2

	# This actually does this somewhere:
	#nagios2::service { "http_${apache2_port}":
	#       check_command => "http_port!${apache2_port}"
	#}

}
